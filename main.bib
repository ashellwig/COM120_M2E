  abstract = {The present study addressed empathy's role in conflict resolution within the context of adolescent same-sex friendship relations. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess dispositional affective empathy and conflict resolution styles (problem solving, conflict engagement, withdrawal and compliance). The data of 307 adolescents (149 boys, 158 girls) were included in a multigroup path analysis with sex as a moderator variable. In agreement with the hypothesis that higher levels of dispositional empathy are associated with more successful conflict management, dispositional affective empathy was found to be positively linked to problem solving and negatively linked to conflict engagement among adolescent boys and girls. Dispositional affective empathy was not related to the two more passive strategies (withdrawal and compliance). Sex differences were demonstrated in empathic tendencies, with girls being more empathic than boys. Sex differences were also established in conflict resolution strategies, with girls using problem solving, withdrawal and compliance more frequently than boys. Both sexes scored equally low on conflict engagement, however, and were found to prefer problem solving to all other conflict resolution strategies. Findings are discussed in terms of previous research on empathy and conflict resolution. Aggr. Behav. 33:48–55, 2007. © 2006 Wiley-Liss; Inc.},

Drawing on stress process theory and social psychological research on empathy, we hypothesize that empathy is more strongly associated with depressive symptoms when personal and social resources are deficient. Using data from a 1985-1986 community sample of adults in southwestern Ontario, we examine the impact of empathy on depressive symptoms and the potential moderating effects of mastery, self-esteem, social support, and education. Results show that the relationship between empathy and depressive symptoms is more strongly positive among individuals who report less education, lower self-esteem, and lower mastery. We discuss implications of these findings.},
