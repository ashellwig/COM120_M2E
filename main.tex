    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    Many people believe that there are distinct differences between how men and
      women communicate and deal with conflict. Entire books have been written
      on the subject, such as John Gray's Men Are from Mars, Women Are from
      Venus.\\%

    In this assignment, you will research conflict and conflict resolution with
      a focus on gender, and you will make your own determinations about the
      impact of gender and cultural differences on interpersonal
      communication.\\%

    You should spend approximately 6.5 hours on this assignment.%

          \item Research the topics of conflict between genders and conflict
            resolution by gender.
          \item Write a one-paragraph summary of your research, focusing on the
            question, how does gender impact conflict resolution styles?
          \item After viewing the movie clip titled ``Gender and Conflict'',
            which conflict resolution style does Brooke exhibit? Which style
            does Gary exhibit?
          \item View the other video clips as well.
          \item What role does gender play, if any, in the different ways Gary
            and Brooke handle conflict?
          \item How could each character change their communication style to
            resolve the conflict?
          \item Put yourself in each character's shoes. How would you react to
            your partner's method of dealing with the conflict?
        \end{itemize}
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item \textbf{Step 1}: Hunt for Definitions
          \item \textbf{Step 2}: Reply to each of the aforementioned questions
            and include examples of conflict, conflict resolution, and the role
            of gender in both conflict and conflict resolution from your own
            experiences in both your personal life and professional life.
        \end{enumerate}
